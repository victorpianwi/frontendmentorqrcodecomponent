## Overview

The project building well was fun. Frontend Mentor already made it easy by providing  some of the styles, colours and the fonts to be used in the project. Everything was provided and it made it an easy task with my already existing knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## My process

I started with extracting the files and checked out the designs and read all instructions. Then i restructured the HTML file took out some things and the styles from the page. The next step was creating my CSS file adding the normalize style sheet in my css and setting base colours and font.

I started with the PC View. Then I started placing the html elements and styling the elements as i went on. I kept on looking at the image trying to make sure my design looks exactly like it in everyway.

After the design process and i was fully done with it i realized my mobile version didn't look like the design's mobile version. I had to increase the height and the width of my parent element in the body to make it look like it luckily i used flexbox so the elements adjusted to the size of the parent element housing the qr code and the text.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Normalize Style Sheet

### What I learned

One of the things i learnt was about a property in css Box Shadow. I knew it already but i couldn't get it to look like the original design and i had to make a research on it to understand it. I had to run to youtube to get it clearer.


```css
.main {
  box-shadow: 0 25px 25px 0 #0000000d;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Resource](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uc4ClUmTYVM) - This helped me for CSS box-shadow property. It was after the video i was able to make it look like the provided design.
